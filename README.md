# pop-up_alert
A Pop-up Alert is a small, dynamic message that appears briefly on the screen to inform users about important actions, system events, or updates, such as form submission success, warnings, or errors. It provides real-time feedback without interrupting the userâ€™s flow, appearing automatically and disappearing after a few seconds.
